# MUD-UI

A tool to manage and edit Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files from the browser.

# Running on the Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi 3b running OpenWRT is used for this project. Below is instructions for connecting to the Raspberry Pi, setting up osMUD and the API and connecting the UI to the Raspberry Pi.

## SSH/SCP
To SSH into the RPi use the command

```bash
$ ssh root@192.168.1.2
```

whilst connected to the RPi using ethernet

To SCP a file to the RPi you need to use legacy options
```bash
$ scp -O [file] root@192.168.1.2:/file/destination
```


## osMUD on the RPi
The osmud service is set to autostart on the RPi, however if need to restart it you can use

```bash
$ service osmud restart
```

alternatively the help menu for the osmud service can be brought up with 

```bash
$ service osmud
```

## Launching the API on the RPi
Before launching the API the database `store.db` must be moved to the location that osmud expects it to be in. This can be done with the commands

```bash
$ mkdir /var/lib/osmud
$ cp /etc/osmud/store.db /var/lib/osmud/store.db
```

osmud also expects a file for the dhcp events log to exist. This can be created with

```bash
$ touch /var/log/osmud-dhcp-events.log
```

The API is an executable script stored in

```bash
$ ~/usr/bin/api
```
And can be launched with 

```bash
$ ./usr/bin/api
```

from the root directory. This starts a server running at `192.168.1.2:8080`

## Launching the UI

The UI is launched on your machine. Use `cd ui` to navigate to the folder.

Run the command 

```bash 
$ npm install
```

 to install all dependancies for the UI

Then use 
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
 to start the UI. This will run at `localhost:3000` in your browser.

# Tools

## MUD File Maker 
Python script for generating arbitrary length MUD files for testing. Specify number of rules to generate. Found in root folder

## Batch Create MUD DB Entry
Run 
```bash
$ ./batch_create_mud_db_entry.sh
```
in /scripts/osmud/ with a number of devices to add to add that number of devices to the database. All devices have name test_device_n and a sequential MAC address.

# Building

## Building the API for the RPi
The go binary has to built using specific arguments for the Raspberry Pi, defined in the Makefile:

```bash
  CGO_Enabled = 0 # OpenWRT does not include the C Standard Library
  CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc # Toolchain for this hardware and version of OpenWRT
  GOOS=linux 
  GOARM=7 # Using a 32-bit OS so ARMv7 not v8
```

## Running Locally

Originally this project was ran locally on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Create database and move the new db access scripts to the correct directories. This is can be performed by using the `install.sh` script:

```bash
$ ./scripts/install.sh
```

2. Start osMUD with the correct parameters as required. An example when using the test bench is provided in `./scripts/run.sh`
3. Build the api. A make file is provided and should create the build binaries in the `bin` folder:
```bash
$ make
```
4. Set the appropriate environment variables and start the api in `./bin/api`.
  - The variables are defined in `/internal/config/appconfig.go`, most times the `DHCP_EVENTS_PATH` will need to be set, for example:
```bash
$ DHCP_EVENTS_PATH=/path/to/events/file ./bin/api
```
- This points to the events file which osMUD monitors, typically provided in the `-e` parameter when starting osMUD.

5. The api should print the port it has started on, you can verify its running by requesting the health endpoint:
```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/health
{"status":"healthy"}
```
6. Navigate to the `ui` directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
7. Next run `npm run dev` to start the development server, more information about the ui sever is provided in the README in this directory.
- If you have changed the port the API starts on, you also need to provide this to the ui in the `API_URL` environment variable. If you have not changed it from the defaults, the ui automatically uses the default which is port 8080. (This is used in `/ui/next.config.mjs` to proxy ui requests to `/api/...` to the local api server at `localhost:8080/...` as explained [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites))
8. You can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and should see the MUD ui.
